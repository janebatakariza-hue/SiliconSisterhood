This progect deals with my long term dreams of making my contributions so as to keep people getting closer to God a.
And so among my ideas that never fade out i realise that i have to keep trying and share my testimony 
about my spiritual journey .
So the Faith foundation is not just a foundation but more of a family that is concerned with leaving the 
world better than we found it.
